                Historically, the artists represented in U.S. art museums have been predominantly male and caucasian. In
                partnership with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) found
                that <span class="art_red_text">72%</span>
                of staff at its member institutions identify as white [1]. This same study found that <span
                    class="art_red_text">60%</span> of museum
                staff are
                women, though only <span class="art_red_text">43%</span> of directorships are held by women, indicating
                a gender gap at the highest levels
                of
                leadership [2].

                        The U.S. art museum sector is grappling with diversity. While previous work has investigated the
                        demographic diversity of museum staffs and visitors, the diversity of artists in their
                        collections has remained unreported. We conduct the first large-scale study of artist diversity
                        in museums. By
                        scraping the public online catalogs of 18 major U.S. museums, deploying a sample of 10,000
                        artist records
                        comprising over 9,000 unique artists to crowdsourcing, and analyzing 45,000 responses, we infer
                        artist genders, ethnicities, geographic origins, and birth decades. Our results are threefold.
                        First, we
                        provide estimates of gender and ethnic diversity at each museum, and overall, we find that 85%
                        of artists are white and 87% are men.

                    <p>
                        Second, we identify museums that are outliers, having significantly higher or lower
                        representation of certain demographic groups than the rest of the pool. Third,
                        we find that the relationship between museum collection mission and artist diversity is weak,
                        suggesting
                        that a museum wishing to increase diversity might do so without changing its emphases on
                        specific time
                        periods and regions. Our methodology can be used to broadly and efficiently assess diversity in
                        other
                        fields.
